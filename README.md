# Exploratory Data Analysis with IPL

Indian Premier League is a T20 cricket tournament played in India. Being a cricket fan myself, I couldn't resist using data science skills when I first got hold of the dataset.

In this repository, I looked at a few of the aspects of IPL and whatever the dataset provides. 
There will be more commits and there will be more aspects of the dataset to look at.

Still hoping for IPL 2020 to happen!!! :)
